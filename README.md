# app-with-typescript

This application shows how to consume an addon which uses `ember-cli-typescript`

There isn't really anything to it - you just need to `ember install ember-cli-typescript`
in the app as well as the addon. Ideally your addon should do this anyway in it's 
default blueprint so that anyone consuming the addon doesn't need to think about it
